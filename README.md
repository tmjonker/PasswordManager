# Password Manager

This is a project utilizing both the Google Tink and Jasypt libraries.  I made this to experiment with encryption and to get a feel for incorporating more inheritance and polymorphism into my work.  Right now, the program will allow you to create a new user and then log in as that user.  Soon, you will be able to store website and application credentials.
